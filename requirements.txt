I mainly downloaded Anaconda navigator which is available in online platform and from I just launch the Spyder(version 3.13) and it simply open.
For this program of friendly welcome to the user I  used user input which take input from user as a string inside the parenthesis to show a message to the user
example
input()
("enter your name")
then normally used some variable to stores the string as well as numeric value.
example 
old=int(input("How old are you ?")) #for integer input
name=input("what is your name ?") #for string input

After that I print the values of input and also give a friendly welcome using print() function
  example
print(f"welcome {name}!")
Here I used f-strings or string formation to joining the text  with the user input string & value instead of using "+" and separated by commas (,).
for example 
print(f"you are {old} years old and you love {hobby}")
and run the code
for single line comment use  #
 and for multiple line

block of statement
